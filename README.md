# TDD project

## Description
> In this project you will implement a class with some methods, but you will do it by doing test-driven development (TDD). Remember that the idea is to write tests first and then the code. This will be verified in your commits history, so it is important to use the proper sequence.


## Built With

- Ruby
- Rspec
- VSCode


# Project Setup
1. Setup the project by creating a new directory from the generated repository.
2. Set up the repository on GitHub and use Gitflow.
3. Create a class called `Solver`.
4. Create a method called `factorial` that takes one argument, an integer `N`, and returns the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) for that    number. The factorial is the multiplication of all integers from 1 to `N` and has the special case that the factorial of 0 is 1. This method only accepts    0 and positive integers, so if a negative integer is given it should raise an exception.
5. Create a method called `reverse` that takes one argument, a string `word`, and returns `word` reversed (e.g. if `word` is `"hello"` it returns `"olleh"`).
6. Create a method called `fizzbuzz` that takes one argument, an integer `N`, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed following these rules:
  - When `N` is divisible by 3, return `"fizz"`.
  - When `N` is divisible by 5, return `"buzz"`.
  - When `N` is divisible by 3 and 5, return `"fizzbuzz"`.
  - Any other case, return `N` as a string (e.g. say `N` is `7` then return `"7"`).
7. Added rubocop linters

## Run tests
> `rspec spec`
